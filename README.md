## Description


In this challenge, we were tasked with building an API for an e-commerce web application using Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize ORM with MySQL. The API allows users to manage product categories, products, and tags, as well as associate tags with products. To achieve this, we designed and implemented models for Category, Product, Tag, and ProductTag, each with specific associations and constraints to handle data relationships effectively.  The API includes various routes to perform CRUD operations on categories, products, tags, and product tags. The GET routes enable us to retrieve all categories, products, and tags, as well as a single category, product, or tag with its associated data. Meanwhile, the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes allow us to create, update, and delete categories, products, and tags seamlessly. Throughout the development process, we demonstrated our proficiency in using Express.js and Sequelize to build a whole e-commerce API. By successfully completing this assignment, we gained valuable experience in working with relational databases, data modeling, and managing complex relationships between entities in a web application.

## Usage


This project presented an exciting challenge, putting our skills to the test in developing a powerful API for an e-commerce web application. Although this API may not encompass all the intricate functionalities found in large-scale e-commerce platforms, it lays a strong foundation for managing vast quantities of product data and handling complex relationships between categories, products, and tags. Through this project, we gained invaluable experience in designing and building APIs with Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize, enabling us to tackle even more ambitious projects in the realm of e-commerce and beyond. With this solid foundation, we are well-prepared to take on more complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions in the dynamic world of web development.
